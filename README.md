### Install from DMG
1. Download the latest `.dmg` from the Releases page or build one via `PackagingResources/package.sh`.
2. Open the DMG and drag `Spotlight Music.app` into the `Applications` folder.
3. If macOS blocks the app due to quarantine, remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Spotlight Music.app"
```

## Usage

## Configuration

### Python Dependencies
The app automatically manages Python dependencies, but you can manually install them:

```

### Authentication (Optional)
For enhanced features, you can provide YouTube Music authentication:

1. Create `headers_auth.json` in the app's Application Support directory:
   ```
   ~/Library/Application Support/SpotlightMusic/headers_auth.json
   ```

2. Follow the [ytmusicapi authentication guide](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/setup.html) to generate the file.
